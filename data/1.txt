Initialize Library
It is necessary for applications to initialize Foxit PDF SDK before calling any APIs. The function
foxit::common::Library::Initialize is provided to initialize Foxit PDF SDK. A license should be
purchased for the application and pass unlock key and code to get proper supports. When there is
no need to use Foxit PDF SDK any more, please call function foxit::common::Library::Release to
release it.
Note The parameter "sn" can be found in the "gsdk_sn.txt" (the string after "SN=") and the "key" can be found in the
"gsdk_key.txt" (the string after "Sign=").
